Gush
====
Gush is an experimental torrent search engine that aggregates results from multiple different systems into one interface. It is designed to take search results from multiple torrent indexes, merge duplicate torrent's trackers and deliver everything asynchronously to a JavaScript powered interface.

#### Disclaimer
**This software is not built to aid copyright infringement**. It is designed purely as an experiment into the retrieval of information from multiple different sources. Please **do not** use this software for any activity that may be illegal.

Included with Gush are several data sources for third party websites. These files are intended as examples of how the software works and are not officially supported or endorsed by the websites they connect to. As such, their use may be against the terms of service of the websites they represent.

## Installation

Gush requires the following components to work correctly:

* Composer
* PHP 5.3+

It is advisable to use a **[release](https://github.com/tombazza/gush/releases)** rather than the trunk which may have issues. To set up a copy of Gush, extract the source code to a directory and run:

`$ php composer.phar install`

#### Configuration

First create your password file and store it somewhere outside your web root. It should contain only a plain-text password.

Next, rename `config.php.dist` to `config.php`. You will need to edit this file to match your local settings.

* **passcode_file** (string) - path to the login passcode
* **adapter_settings** (array) - options to be passed to **Zend\Http\Client**
* **engines** (array) - list of content upstream engines found in `includes/Data`
* **show_errors** (boolean) - enable or disable showing of errors from PHP (does not silence exceptions)
